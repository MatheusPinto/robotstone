This project is an application of the \mbox{\hyperlink{class_robotstone}{Robotstone}} benchmark on the Raspberry Pi 3 platform, using the following configurations. As native system, Xenomai 3.\+0.\+8 on Raspbian Linux 4.\+9.\+80 Debian 9 stretch was used (the image was downloaded in \href{http://www.cs.ru.nl/lab/xenomai/raspberrypi.html}{\texttt{ http\+://www.\+cs.\+ru.\+nl/lab/xenomai/raspberrypi.\+html}}). Eclipse I\+DE for C/C ++ Developers Version\+: Kepler Service Release 2 was used as the development I\+DE. The compiler used was arm-\/linux-\/gnueabihf. The project was cross-\/compiled in Eclipse on an x-\/86 machine. The main.\+cpp file has the main function. It defines if the generated executable will be used by the Master or Slave node. To more instructions see the main.\+cpp file itself.
